## D001: Node-local full gates and native machine capacity

Full-gate exclusion is keyed by the resolved node id within an instance. The
stable lock is `.brain/gates/<sha256-node-id>.lock`; display labels do not define
identity. `gate-lock --node <node>` selects a node explicitly. Without that option,
node folders, registered homes, workbenches and worktrees are ranked together by
the most specific containing path. Repeated anchors for one node are deduplicated;
equal-depth matches for different nodes and unbound context refuse. A containing
node folder cannot mask a deeper registered home or workbench.

Native monolithic verification and lane verification acquire the node lock before
joining machine admission. A lane run retains the node lock across every command,
while each command joins the native FIFO queue afresh. Different nodes can run
concurrently without same-node waiters consuming machine slots. Capacity remains
in the existing machine policy: configurable `verify_day` and `verify_night`, with
defaults of two daytime slots and one nighttime slot. A gate wrapper does not
reserve an additional machine slot.

Nested commands retain the same node's descriptor through exec and explicit
`pass_fds`. Inherited proof binds the node id, stable path, regular-file inode and
held open-file-description lock; incomplete, closed, stale, unlocked or mismatched
proof refuses. Owners close their descriptors without explicitly unlocking, so a
surviving verification child retains exclusion. Lock files are never replaced or
unlinked during normal operation. Lock-path safety checks reject linked and
nonregular targets without interfering with scoped verification-log cleanup.

Regression tests use isolated instances and controlled process barriers to prove
same-node exclusion, different-node overlap, configured capacities, inherited
ownership and cleanup, without generating system load.

Isolated scenario fixtures temporarily remove only enclosing gate environment
proof from both their subprocess environment and in-process environment, restoring
it during cleanup. They retain the enclosing descriptor and lock. Runtime
cross-node proof refusal remains unchanged. An in-repository regression runs
existing subprocess and native lane fixtures under a real gate wrapper, then
checks that enclosing proof is restored and its descriptor still owns the lock.

## D002: Select the initial job runtime before the first ledger append

Resolve a new worktree job's runtime with the existing `worker_route` resolver
before `job_started` appends its first ledger row. The initial row then reflects
the creation-time builder route, including existing runtime pins, class defaults
and inherited model selection.

A later brief's explicit `--runtime` or `--model` choice remains a later route
update through `record_job_route`. It does not change the original committed
ledger revision. Reusing the resolver preserves runtime/model precedence and
model-aware subscription selection; this change adds no flags or routing semantics.

The regression reads the first committed ledger revision before generating a
brief, then checks that the brief retains the expected runtime and model. Its
cases cover class defaults, a node runtime pin, node and instance class routing,
and inherited model configuration without activating inherited runtime policy.



## D401: Git-owned landing and compatible batch advice

A clean main checkout is fast-forwarded by Git with autostash and ignored-file
replacement disabled. An unoccupied main uses one compare-and-swap ref update.
Publication never rolls back a checkout or ref. Closure requires an explicit
successful publication receipt; ambiguous results retain the journal for repair.
Host settlement remains pending until separately supplied, validated evidence.

A completed job with valid recorded-base evidence and a clean merge may receive
batch-eligibility advice after main advances. This advisory never marks it ready
against current main: the integration result still requires verification. Ordinary
readiness, conflict refusals and worker-owned packets remain unchanged. Display
advice validates recorded lane evidence without executing lane-map commands.
